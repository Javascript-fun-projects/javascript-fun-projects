                <p>I really appreciate Brad's teaching rhythm and I learn faster with projects (please make more project-based course!) For the speed, it just perfect for me with 1.5 times of normal speed. Now is time to go for other courses of Brad!</p>

                <p>I enjoyed building each projects. Section with Q&A is a good place to see more ideas how to add functionality to those small projects. There are some tiny bugs as those projects just show the idea how to do certain things, so, you can improve all code, it will take time and you will learn more things by yourself. Thanks Brand and Florin.</p>

                <p>Another great course from Brad. Each project was excellently presented and explained in easy to understand terms. This course will give you a lot of experience with DOM manipulation and I found by the end of the course that I was able to do a lot of the projects on my own and afterwards I watched Brads solution. This really is a great course and I am really glad that I purchased it as I felt that I have learnt a lot by completing it.</p>

                <p>This course is awesome, the way that Brad teaches the things are top notch and always well humored! The projects are very useful and i've learned a lot of stuff that i didn't know it was possible to do with vanilla html, css and js! Totally Recommend it!</p>
